WHAT IS THIS?

This is the source for the simple tiny url service that is 
currently running at http://tiny.io.

tiny.io runs using "Nunja", a simple libevent-based web
server. It can be easily scaled by deploying multiple 
Nunja-based daemons under the pound load-balancer.
A sample pound.cfg is included.  Data is stored in MongoDB.


DEPENDENCIES

This tiny url service is built using the following components:
	Nu		The Nu scripting language
	NuMongoDB	Objective-C interface to MongoDB
	NuJSON		Objective-C library for JSON serialization
	NuMarkup 	Nu operators for HTML generation	
	Nunja		A libevent-based webserver for use with Nu
	NuHTTPHelpers	HTTP helpers for use with Nu and Nunja

A MongoDB installation is also necessary.


A TINY API 

Currently tiny urls are created with a call to the tiny.io API.

Examples:

1. curl http://tiny.io/api/shorten -d url=http://www.neontology.com -d key=TINY_KEY

   This creates and returns a random string as the tiny url.

2. curl http://tiny.io/api/shorten -d url=http://programming.nu -d tiny=nu -d key=TINY_KEY

   This attempts to use the specified string as the tiny url.

Tiny url creation will fail if a specified "tiny" value is in use, 
and if a url already has been mapped to a tiny value, that value will
be used instead of any specified or newly-generated value.


AUTHENTICATION

Currently the tiny server uses a trivial method of authentication. URL 
shortening requests must include a user key that is read from the 
TINY_KEY environment variable.
